            <u><h2>Cricket</h2></u>
            <u><p><b>Kapil Dev<br></b></u> When a prolific batsman comes along from the production hub that is India, it isn't particularly surprising. India wouldn't blink if the successor to a Tendulkar or a Kohli comes along tomorrow. However, tell them that at one point, Test cricket's highest wicket-taker was one of their own, and they will give you a blank stare of disbelief. Or perhaps ridicule you. Kapildev Ramlal Nikhanj, arguably India's best fast bowler, and certainly India's best all-rounder, will always be remembered for leading the country to the title that changed Indian cricket into phenomenon it is today: the 1983 World Cup triumph. As Kapil Dev lifted that chalise of champions, several young cricketers, including a frizzy-haired Mumbaikar, watched in awe.

                Kapil Dev was known for his energetic curved run-up and lethal outswingers as a result of that open-chested action. With the bat, he was an aggressive lower-middle order batsman who could cause carnage with the bat in an era before helmets, monster bats, or T20s. On the field, he was known for his inspirational leadership and athletic fielding. Perhaps the fittest and most disciplined man in the Indian dressing room at the time, Kapil is still remembered for that backward running catch of Sir Vivian Richards. Furthermore, Kapil Dev never missed a Test match due to fitness issues. It would be fair to say that his value to the team lay beyond numbers, but even the stats bow down before him: he remains the only man in the history of the game to have taken 400 wickets and scored more than 5000 runs in Test cricket - making him one of the greatest all-rounders of all time.
                
                Kapil made his debut in 1978 and gradually started to produce performances of substance, especially in Test cricket. In his early years, he came across as a raw talent who was keen on just 'ripping his shoulder off' every ball, and 'tonking the leather off the ball' when he had the bat. The approach saw him score India's fastest Test half-century (off 33 balls) against Pakistan in his very third match. He came of age in the home series against Pakistan in 1979-80, where his all-round performances (32 wickets and 278 runs) helped India win 2 Tests. In the series, he became the youngest player to reach 100 wickets and 1000 runs in Test cricket. For the next two seasons, steady performances with the ball and useful contributions with the bat made him a certainty in the side and a viable candidate for captainship. Perhaps due to the nascent stages of the format or his priorities stacked up in favour of Test cricket, his ODI performances didn't quite live up to his antics in Test cricket.
                
                And then, it happened. Kapil Dev replaced Sunil Gavaskar in the 1982-83 season and was appointed the captain for the 1983 World Cup to be played in England. He played one of the best ODI innings of all time in a must-win match against Zimbabwe at Tunbridge Wells, where India were reeling at 17 for 5. Without any official telecast of the match due to a BBC strike, Kapil strode out and tore apart the Zimbabwean bowling to hammer 175* off 138 balls - a lesson in counter-attacking cricket, and a lesson decades ahead of its time. The scarcely believable knock gave India the momentum which they seized, and went on to win the coveted vessel of victory for the first time, beating the West Indies in the league stages, the hosts in the semi-final, and finally, edging the mighty West Indies yet again in a low-scoring final at Lord's.
                
                In the hangover of the World Cup triumph, a slump in Kapil's batting form meant Gavaskar would return to captaincy briefly. However, he regained his leadership role and led India for the title defence in the 1987 World Cup at home. India reached the semi-finals but lost unexpectedly to England. Furthermore, in a league game against Australia, Kapil Dev agreed with the umpires to increase Australiaâ€™s total from 268 to 270 as one boundary had mistakenly been marked as 4 instead of 6 by the scorers - India went on to lose the game by 1 run, and Kapil came to rue his generosity. Kapil Dev took responsibility for the semi-final loss upon himself and never captained India again, although he continued to be India's first-choice pacer until he retired in 1994 as Test cricket's highest wicket-taker.
                
                After retirement, Kapil Dev became India's coach for a brief period. A 0-3 loss against Australia, a 0-2 loss to South Africa and accusations of match-fixing saw him step down from the post in tears as he announced that he was leaving the game forever. However, he was cleared of all charges and went on to win the accolade of the Wisden Indian Cricketer of the Century, ahead of Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar. . </p>
